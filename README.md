## Overview
The NFIQ repository includes implementations and tools for fingerprint quality assessment. These tools help evaluate fingerprint images based on quality scores, which are critical for biometric applications such as deduplication, authentication, and identification.

The repository is structured to accommodate multiple versions or implementations of NFIQ. The currently supported version is:
- **[NFIQ1.0](nfiq1.0/README.md)**
